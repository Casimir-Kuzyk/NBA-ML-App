This app is meant to predict NBA game outcomes, and compare them to user input winner probabilities to determine the expected value.

The app currently features:
automatically update dataset from NBA API
Binary classification using a feed-forward NN, based on points per game and points against features.


TODO:
more feature engineering (player status, player props, points for/against specific teams...)
XGboost
logistic regression
